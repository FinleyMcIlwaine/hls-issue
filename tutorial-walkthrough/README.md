# Plutus Smart Contract Tutorial Walkthrough

This directory contains the code I wrote while working through IOHK's Plutus Tutorial.

## How to Run
1. Install Docker
2. Install VSCode
3. Install the Remote Development Extension for VSCode
4. Open this folder in VSCode
5. Click the remote development icon in the bottom left, and select "Open Folder in Container", and select "Open".

A new, remote VSCode instance should start, with this folder opened. Haskell IDE Engine will begin building the project with Cabal once you select a `.hs` file. Once it is done building, you should be able to use the devcontainer as a full Haskell IDE.
